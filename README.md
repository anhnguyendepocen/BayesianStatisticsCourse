# Bayesian Statistics
A PhD-level course at [EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/en).

Syllabus [here](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/doutorado/estatistica-bayesiana) and tentative programme [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kuE-_NeSQzaBNnWc9vezXSbKfSIGQoLdmmb2zRDbOng/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Pre-requisites
- Probability theory with measure. [Jeff Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/)'s book, [A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory](http://probability.ca/jeff/grprobbook.html), is a good resource.
- Classical Statistics at the same level as [Mathematical Statistics](https://emap.fgv.br/disciplina/doutorado/mathematical-statistics). For a review, I suggest 
[Theory of Statistics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387945460) by [Mark Schervish](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/people/faculty/mark-schervish). 

# Books
- [The Bayesian Choice](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-71599-1) (BC) by [Christian Robert](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/7224/xian) will be our main source.
- [A first course in Bayesian statistical methods](https://pdhoff.github.io/book/) (FC) by [Peter Hoff](https://stat.duke.edu/research/hoff#:~:text=Hoff,-Professor%20of%20Statistical&text=Peter%20Hoff%20develops%20statistical%20methodology,area%20inference%2C%20and%20multigroup%20analysis.) is a good all-purpose introduction. 
- [Bayesian Theory](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470316870) (BT) by [Jos√© Bernardo](https://www.uv.es/bernardo/) and [Adrian Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Smith_(statistician)) is a technical behemoth, suitable for use as a reference guide.

- [Principles of Uncertainty](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/principles-uncertainty-joseph-kadane/10.1201/9781315167565) by the inimitable [J. Kadane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Born_Kadane) is a book about avoiding being a sure loser. See [this](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~xian/uncertain.pdf) review by Christian Robert.
- [Bayesian Learning](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/BayesLearnCourse) by [Mattias Vilani](mattiasvillani.com) is a book for a computation-minded audience. 
- Michael Betancourt's website is a treasure trove of rigorous, modern and insightful applied Bayesian statistics. See [this](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html#1_Questioning_Authority) as a gateway drug.

# Syllabus
## Lecture 0: Overview
- An overview of computing techniques for Bayesian inference can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06425.pdf).
- [What is a statistical model?](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-19/issue-1/Modern-Bayesian-Asymptotics/10.1214/088342304000000134.full) by Peter McCullagh gives a good explanation of what a statistical model is. See also BC Ch1.
- There are a few [Interpretations of Probability](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/) and its important to understand them so the various schools of statistical inference make sense. 
- [WHAT IS BAYESIAN/FREQUENTIST INFERENCE?](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/what-is-bayesianfrequentist-inference/) by [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/) is a must read in order to understand what makes each inference paradigm tick.

## Lecture 1: Belief functions, coherence, exchangeability

## Lecture 2: Priors I: rationale and construction
- The [SHeffield ELicitation Framework (SHELF)](http://tonyohagan.co.uk/shelf/) is a package for rigorous elicitation of probability distributions.

## Lecture 3: Priors II: types of priors; implementation, conjugate analysis
- [Hidden Dangers of Specifying Noninformative Priors](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2012.695938) is a must-read for those who wish to understand the counter-intuitive nature of prior measures and their push-forwards.
- [The Case for Objective Bayesian Analysis](https://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/lista/pdfTFOW5ADDD0.pdf) is a good read to try and put objective Bayes on solid footing. 

## Lecture 4: Bayesian point estimation

## Lecture 5: Bayesian interval estimation
- [Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes)'s 1976 monograph [Confidence Intervals vs Bayesian Intervals](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-6581-2_9) is a great source of useful discussion. [PDF](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-010-1436-6_6.pdf).

## Lecture 6: Bayesian Testing

## Lecture 7: Asymptotics

## Lecture 8: Model choice

## Lecture 9: Applications
- See [Reporting Bayesian Results](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0193841X20977619?journalCode=erxb) for a guide on which summaries are indispensable in a Bayesian analysis.
-  [Visualization in Bayesian workflow](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12378) is a great paper about making useful graphs for a well-calibrated Bayesian analysis.

## Lecture 10: Discussion Bayes vs Frequentism
**Disclaimer**: everything in this section needs to be read with care so one does not become a zealot!

- See Jayne's monograph above.
- See [Frequentism and Bayesianism: A Practical Introduction](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/) for a five-part discussion of the Bayesian vs Orthodox statistics.
